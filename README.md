Introduction
============

**Jump Horse!** (in italian *Zompa Cavallo!*) is an italian card game, tipical of the Christmas time. At least 2 players are required, but the game is funnier with 6 or more people.

The name means the particular behaviour that the card with the horsemen has in this game.

Before starting
===============

Each player starts with 4 *fiches*. The first dealer shuffles the deck, then the first round starts.

Round
=====

The dealer take the first card and says loudly the name of the first player to the right. The following is what can happen:

* the card is an ace, the called player pays 2 *fiches* and put them in the center of the table; if the player has only 1 *fiche*, also the first following player must pay a *fiche* (when an ace occurs 2 *fiches* must always be payed);
* the card is a "fante", the called player pays 1 *fiche* to the previous player;
* the card is a horsemen, the called player pays 1 *fiche* to the player that is two places after;
* the card is a king, the called player takes 1 *fiche* back from the center of the table;
* nothing happens for the other cards.

The round ends when all cards are taken from the deck. 4 *fiches* should be in the center of the table. At this point, the player next to the dealer, on the right, becomes the new dealer and a new round begins.

The game ends if all but one player have lost their *fiches* and he wins the game, independently if the round is ended or not.

The dead
========

When a player has no more *fiches* he is called **dead**. When the dealer calls the cards, a dead player is not counted, but he can come back to the game receiving a *fiche* from another player (with a "fante" or an horsemen) or making other non dead player speak with him.

If a player speaks with a dead, this player gives him a *fiche*.

The dealer can speak with everybody without losing *fiches*. The dealer can also be a dead and can take *fiches* back in the same way as the other players.

Variations
==========

It's up to you to choose what happen if a player is called with a king card but there are still no *fiches* on the table.

You can also make the game funnier adding new rules to the cards. Here are some tips:

* with a given card all players give a *fiche* to the following or preceding player;
* with a given card all dead players take a *fiche* from the following or preceding player;
* a player can bet to the following card to earn *fiches*;
* ...
